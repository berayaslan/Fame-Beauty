# Fame Beauty E-Commerce Site 

## Introduction

While there are many cosmetic e-commerce sites in our country, there is not yet a site dedicated exclusively to world-famous women's brands. To address this gap, Fame Beauty, a web-based e-commerce platform, has been developed. This site will allow users to easily filter and access cosmetic brands founded by globally renowned women, all in one convenient location.
